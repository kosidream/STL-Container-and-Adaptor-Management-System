STL Containers and Container Adaptors (Menu-Driven Program) 

Overview

This program is a menu-driven application designed to demonstrate the usage of STL (Standard Template Library) containers and container adaptors in C++. The program allows users to interact with four major types of containers: Vectors, Lists, Stacks, and Queues. Each container is explored through menu options, enabling users to perform actions like adding, removing, and sorting elements.

Features

The program offers the following options for interacting with STL containers and adaptors:

Vector Container:
Dynamic arrays that automatically resize.
Perform operations like adding elements, inserting at specific indices, retrieving, erasing, sorting, and clearing elements.
List Container:
Non-contiguous memory allocation for faster insertions and deletions.
Allows adding elements, inserting at specific positions, erasing, sorting, and clearing the list.
Stack Container Adaptor:
Implements a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure.
Perform push, top, and pop operations to add, view, and remove elements from the stack.
Queue Container Adaptor:
Implements a First In, First Out (FIFO) structure.
Perform enqueue, dequeue, front, and back operations to manage elements in the queue.
